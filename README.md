# Character Sheet Creator for D&D 5e

This is an exercise for the Java Academy 2023. The purpose of the program is to create a .txt file with pg details after asking the user
some questions about the pg creation.

# Missing features and warnings

The program now works only for level 1 characters, even if it asks for user inputs about the level. Moreover there are only a limited set of races,
background, classes, languages and spells; the goal was to practice using Java, not to heavily insert manually constant stuff into the data structures.

# Language used

It's a mix of Italian (for races, classes and languages) and English (for background equipment and spells)

## Works only for level 1
## Only warrior, mage and cleric
## Limited set of races, languages and spells
## Work in progress
